									<h2>Definition: Information assessment</h2>
									<p>Having located relevant evidence, you need to be able to critically assess its quality before you use it. Knowing how to assess what you have found will enhance your confidence in using evidence to make decisions.</p>
									<h2>Key Points</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>Evidence can be assessed in several ways.
										</li>
										<li>The reliability of the conclusions we draw from evidence may be influenced by the research methods used in the generation of that evidence.
										</li>
										<li>It can be useful to look at the original data upon which evidence is based, rather than relying entirely on the conclusions and interpretations of others.
										</li>

  								<h2>1. Does the evidence come from a credible source?</h2>
									<p>Evidence is available to you from lots of different sources, but not all sources of evidence are equally good. It is important to decide whether the information you have found is of high quality from a variety of perspectives including where it originated, its authority, currency, objectivity and suitability for your purposes.</p>

									<h2>2. How reliable is the evidence?</h2>
									
									<p>Critical appraisal skills focus on expecting the conclusions reached by research reports to be justified by the data collected. The type of evidence (for example, qualitative or quantitative) and the ways or methods by which it was gathered (for example, a survey, a randomised trial, or a focus group) will have an impact on how confident you are about the conclusions it puts forward. The evidence from some methods, such as larger studies and systematic reviews, tends to be seen as more reliable than that from others. However, all methods, from a large systematic review of a number of random controlled trials to a single case study, have their own merits and are appropriate at different times.</p>

                  <p>The following resources give a brief overview of different research methods and also cover general points for appraising research and more specific issues relating to particular types of research methods.</p>

                  <h2>3. Does the source accurately summarise the evidence that has been gathered?</h2>
                  <p>Even the best research can be intentionally or unintentionally misrepresented, so it can be useful to go beyond the executive summary or abstract in order to better understand what the research is telling you. This helps you to decide whether you agree with what the author is telling you about the evidence that has been gathered.</p>
